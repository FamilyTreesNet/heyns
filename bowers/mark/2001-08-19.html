                  too much into the eggs, often used by artists to suggest 
                  female sexuality and fertility; he simply likes the ovate form 
                  for its own sake.</B> </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
            <P>
            <P>ST. JOSEPH</P>
            <P>The Box Factory is not a factory -- at least, no longer in the 
            literal sense -- and most of the artists currently featured in the 
            building's gallery claim not to be artists.</P>
            <P>But there's no hiding the Box Factory's industrial heritage: 
            Heavy wood beams, scarred plank flooring, exposed brick walls and 
            steel fixtures, left largely unchanged in an ongoing effort by the 
            Berrien Artist Guild to retool the three-story manufacturing 
            landmark as an area arts center, pay respect to its former life. And 
            there's no denying that the four people represented in the Box 
            Factory's eclectic and enjoyable show "Recession from Blue" -- 
            whether they call themselves artists or not -- have, in fact, 
            created art.</P>
            <P>"I try to stay away from that word as much as possible," says 
            Mark Bowers of South Bend, whose frenetic, black-and-white drawings 
            and oddball constructions reflect the uncertainty he says is a 
            natural result of being a 23-year-old male with a museum job. They 
            also serve as a graphic foil for the work of his female colleagues: 
            Naomi Hettig's lively and sometimes playful pottery; Carolyn 
            Tarzon's tiny, colorful experiments in space, and a 
            thought-provoking series of ceramic sculpture by Lisa Hirsch.</P>
            <P>"I'd say I like to make things. I'm intrigued by creating things. 
            Does that make me an artist?" Bowers shrugs. "What's the difference 
            between a doodle and a work of fine art? I don't have a clue, but 
            it's a serious question, and one that's been prompted by working in 
            a museum where I'm bringing works of art in and out all the 
            time."</P>
            <P><B>Picture puzzles</P>
            <P></B>Bowers' pieces, from the interactive, egg-shape figurines of 
            "Jingle, Jangle, Junk" to the more nuanced, multilayered scribblings 
            of "Bear, Bee, Bunny," manage to project simplicity and confusion, 
            whimsy and menace, all at the same time. They tell stories in a 
            near-impenetrable visual language combining cartoonish characters, 
            streams of text erased almost to illegibility ("The viewer can't 
            know too much, because it's very personal," the artist, or 
            non-artist, explains), angry-looking slashes, free-ranging curves 
            and arithmetical symbols.</P>
            <P>Bowers compares the drawings to rebus puzzles -- those short, 
            pictorial messages we remember from childhood in which an eye, heart 
            and pointing finger would translate into "I love you." Here, the 
            messages are quite a bit more complicated; only Bowers himself can 
            decipher them with certainty, and he tends to demur from spelling 
            the stories out for any inquisitive viewer who manages to corner 
            him.</P>
            <P>He will explain a few isolated symbols, though. Pointing to an 
            equals sign in one piece, Bowers says, "The viewer is asked, 'What 
            does it really equal?' I'm not sure if it's supposed to equal 
            anything, but I want to ask the question."</P>
            <P><B>Circle of time</P>
            <P></B>Sculptor and ceramist Lisa Hirsch -- a friend and former 
            college classmate of Bowers -- seems to be on a path of inquiry 
            herself, but with very different results. There's a patient, 
            contemplative quality to Hirsch's large-scale works, "Movable Feet" 
            and "Labyrinth of Life," two profound illustrations of time as a 
            helical, rather than linear, phenomenon.</P>
            <P>Hirsch says she conceived "Labyrinth" after spending several 
            weeks in Rome, and the piece's circular structure and earthy palette 
            certainly suggest ancient architecture. But the radiating rings of 
            curved ceramic tiles -- one for every day of the year -- also call 
            to mind the age rings visible on a felled tree.</P>
            <P>"I was interested in how nature tells time, in how things grow," 
            explains Hirsch, whereas the "Feet" piece reflects the human 
            tendency to measure time by journeys taken and distance traveled, 
            whether real or metaphorical. Other works simply grew out of 
            Hirsch's desire to test her materials' possibilities and 
            limitations.</P>
            <P>Like photography, another medium Hirsch works in (her "Sarah 
            Series" of photographs is also on display in the Box Factory 
            gallery), ceramics is both an art and a science, one whose 
            combination of many variables often yields unanticipated 
results.</P>
            <P>"A lot of my stuff is about going through a process and figuring 
            out how that process will create a good piece of work," she says. 
            Her experiments typically involve a great deal of trial and error, 
            but also the joy of discovery.</P>
            <P>"You try to build things as well as you know how, but once you 
            shut the kiln door or brick it up, it's all out of your control. ... 
            Sometimes it's Christmas when you open that door, and there's 
            something wonderful waiting for you," she adds, smiling. "Sometimes 
            it's great, but it wasn't what you expected, and you learn to love 
            it. And sometimes it's a disaster, when all you can say is, 'Okay, 
            I'll rebuild and try again.' It's kind of like life in that 
way."</P>
            <P><B>Getting in deep</P>
            <P></B>Carolyn Tarzon applies a similar spirit of experimentation to 
            her two-dimensional artworks.</P>
            <P>"I don't have a big art background," admits Tarzon, who works as 
            a rehabilitation counselor. "But I've always been interested in art. 
            For me, it's about the thinking process. I really enjoy thinking and 
            resolving issues."</P>
            <P>At issue in Tarzon's current series of mixed-media works -- 
            abstract thumbnail sketches uniformly sandwiched in glass -- is 
            space. Each little piece attempts to create a feeling of depth 
            within the limited confines of one flat square inch.</P>
            <P>"I didn't let myself use perspective to enhance the sense of 
            distance," says Tarzon, who achieved her goal instead through 
            contrasts of color, intensity and texture; forms and lines that 
            suggest movement, and other compositional tricks. Moreover, the 
            pieces tend to live larger than actual size because the viewer has 
            to experience them at close range, one at a time.</P>
            <P>"They draw you in," the artist observes. "Your memory of them 
            when you walk away and think about an individual piece -- it's 
            bigger in your mind, because it's pulled you in."</P>
            <P><B>Random beauty</P>
            <P></B>Naomi Hettig's artistic approach is not so methodical. Like 
            Hirsch, though, she seems to take a Zen satisfaction in the 
            unpredictability of clay media.</P>
            <P>"You just pray it comes out," she says, laughing. "You're never 
            confident about anything until you put it on display."</P>
            <P>Hettig runs a local craft shop and makes free-form pottery "for 
            relaxation," she says. The Box Factory show is her first, and the 
            pieces on display -- a wild assortment of plates, vessels of all 
            kinds and even some bug-eyed ceramic fish destined for her home 
            aquarium -- do convey a certain "creative person blowing off steam" 
            quality.</P>
            <P>"None of my work starts with sketches," she reveals. "A lot of 
            people in classes say, 'How do you think of stuff to do?' And I have 
            no idea. It just comes as the piece grows."</P>
            <P>The inspiration for one particularly appealing piece, "Pot with 
            Wooden Feet," came while Hettig cleaned up the yard after a storm. 
            She'd been working on the three-sided pot and knew she wanted to 
            elevate it somehow; seeing all those branches on the ground gave her 
            the answer.</P>
            <P>Other ideas come from Hettig's vast collection of miscellaneous 
            treasures, from the wine corks and beer bottle caps celebrated in 
            the sand-molded glass sculpture "Angel of Spirits" to the various 
            stamping devices that give her plates pattern and texture.</P>
            <P>"It's pretty random," the ceramist says of her design strategy. 
            "I don't consider myself an artist. I just enjoy making these 
            things."</P>
